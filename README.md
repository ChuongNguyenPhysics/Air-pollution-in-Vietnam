# Air-pollution-in-Vietnam
Air pollution is one of the most concerning problems world- wide. It leads to the necessary time series forecasting particulate mat- ter (PM) concentrations. In this study, we propose an effective way to  improve the results of PM10 and PM25 forecasting tasks by combin- ing meteorological features and timestamp information using datasets  from Hanoi, Vietnam. By conducting five deep learning models, MLP,  1D-CNN, LSTM, Bi-LSTM, and Stacked LSTM, the experimental re- sults show that adding more timestamps information helped improve  the results in 68% of cases compared to other methods. Furthermore, the Vanilla LSTM model with combined features will give better results  in the long-term forecast than the other. We plan to extend our ap- proach by continuing to combine more features from multiple sources  and applying more robust models for the main problem.
